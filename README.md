# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```


Make sure to run `npm install` in both the root directory and the `web` directory

run the node 
`npx hardhat node`
deploy scripts
`npx hardhat run script/deploy.ts`
run react server
`cd web && npm start`
